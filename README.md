<h1> Project: La Panthère </h1>
Welcome to the La Panthère project, an OPENCLASSROOM assignment that I've enhanced for search engine optimization.( Little SEO project )

<h2>About La Panthère</h2>
La Panthère is a web design agency aimed at making businesses more attractive and visible on the internet. When I first encountered the site, it faced several challenges:

<h3>Poor Performance Scores<h3>
Lack of Mobile Responsiveness
Missing Heading Tags (h1, h2, h3)
Unoptimized Images (size, colors, etc.)
<h3>What I've Improved</h3>
Throughout this project, I've tackled these issues and made significant enhancements to the site's performance and user experience. My optimizations have not only improved search engine visibility but also made the website more engaging and accessible across various devices.

For detailed information on the changes I've implemented, please refer to the project documentation and commit history.
